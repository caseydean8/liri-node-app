# liri-node-app

Liri is a node.js application that allows the user to access Bandsintown, Spotify, and OMDB API information from the command line.

The command * node liri concert-this "insert artist name" * shows the venue name, location, and date of a performers next concert.

* node liri spotify-this-song "insert song title" * displays the artist, song title, a preview link to the song at spotify.com, and which album the song is from.

* node liri "insert movie title" * displays the title, release year, Imdb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings, country, plot, and actors of the movie entered. 

Liri is dependent on several node packages, including axios, dotenv, fs, moment, and node-spotify-api.
